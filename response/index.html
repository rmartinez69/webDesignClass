      During my first go-around of the exhibition, I found it a bit confusing. Why was I looking at chairs and random lamps? However, the second time I went around and spent longer looking at the selections, much of it resonated with me. From my perspective, many design changes relate to how humans interact with one another and with the spaces and objects around us.

      The need to create emojis isn’t necessarily surprising, as drawings and images have long been a principal form of communication. By contrast, a glass shaped to mimic cupped hands is more unexpected. So much of design stems from the urge to create, regardless of strict necessity—often ideas that emerge from a creative mind, whether or not they feel intuitive to all of us.

          <h3>Liquid Skin Drinking Cup</h3>
          <p>This feels very natural—and it was designed to. An innovation drawn from an instinctive gesture.</p>

          <p>A new way of viewing the inner workings of music production. This design reveals what’s often left unsaid in the music we listen to and create.</p>

          <p>I might be biased—this is one of my favorite fashion items. Still, a reimagined Japanese design in leather is definitely a turning point.</p>
