  <h1>In My Life</h1>
  <p class="byline">by The Beatles</p>

  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>There are <span class="pop flip3d">places</span> I remember</p>
    <p>All my <span class="glow">life</span>, though some have <span class="pop">changed</span> (Ooh, ooh, ooh)</p>
    <p>Some <span class="mark">forever</span>, not for better</p>
    <p>Some have gone and some <span class="tilt">remain</span> (Ooh, ooh, ooh)</p>

    <p>All these <span class="pop">places</span> had their moments</p>
    <p>With <span class="glow">lovers</span> and <span class="glow">friends</span>, I still can recall</p>
    <p>Some are dead and some are living</p>
    <p>In my <span class="glow">life</span>, I've loved them all</p>

    <p>But of all these <span class="glow">friends</span> and lovers</p>
    <p>There is no one compares with <span class="pop">you</span> (Ooh, ooh, ooh)</p>
    <p>And these <span class="pop">memories</span> lose their <span class="tilt">meaning</span></p>
    <p>When I think of <span class="glow">love</span> as something new (Ooh, ooh, ooh)</p>

    <p>Though I know I'll never lose affection</p>
    <p>For people and things that went before</p>
    <p>I know I'll often stop and <span class="tilt">think</span> about them</p>
    <p>In my <span class="glow">life</span>, I <span class="bounce-spin">love</span> <span class="pop">you</span> <span class="pop">more</span></p>
