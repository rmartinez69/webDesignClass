        Fahrenheit 451 — Ray Bradbury
        <small>Farenheit 451 tells the story of a world where books are a prohibited item. It follows a fireman, Guy Montag, who steals a book during one of his mandated raids and burns. He then begins have a conflicting internal combat regarding the rules of his society and censorship.<br> 
        I really enjoy this book because it's a dystopian novel that explores the possibility of what our world could become one day. It's such an interesting idea that we might take books and knowledge for granted. </small>
      </p>

    <div class="div3 ibm-plex-sans">
      <p>
        Dune — Frank Herbert
        <small>Dune is a saga of books that follow a universe that exists in the future, where the most valuable currency is "spice". In the first book, we follow Paul Atreides, the heir to House of Atreides. After his family is betrayed, he joins the "savage" group known as "Fremen" that live on Arrakis. He begins his exploration as he discovers he might be the heir of a throne bigger than his own family. <br>
        I really enjoy this book because of the story telling of politics and society. Frank Herbert does a great job of mixing what is very obviously fiction and non-fiction. Also, the movies are awesome. </small>

        Dime Quién Soy — Julia Navarro
        <small> Dime Quien Soy follows the story of a journalist who is tasked by a very rich woman to follow the trail of her desceased great-grandmother, who was a bit of a figure during the Spanish Civil War. As the story progresses, we see how Amelia (the woman's great grandmother) was an increasingly interesting woman.<br> 
        I like this book because of how entertaining it is. It has a lof of historically accurate facts, but the drama of it all is perfection. It is also really interesting to read about a powerful women in those times, even if it is fiction. </small>

        Either/Or (sequel to The Idiot) — Elif Batuman
        <small> This book tells us the story about Selin, a freshman at college and her weird love story. <br>
        I ove this book because Selin is such an interesting character. While it is a bit of an odd read, I find it so endearing and it's has given me a lot of perspective as a young woman in college as well. </small>

        The Secret History — Donna Tartt
        <small>The Secret History is a book about students living in a small univeristy in Vermont who are part of a very elite Greek class. They are very different characters whi find themselves commiting a crime. The story follows the lead up and what unveils after their crime.<br>
        This is one of my most recent additions into my favorite books. I had never read something like this. I love the wat the author explores the different characters and how the relate to each other. This is a great book to read in the fall!</small>

      <h2 class="ibm-plex-serif-regular">Ode To Reading</h2>
      <h3 class="ibm-plex-serif-regular"> Virginia Armitage McCall </h3>
      <p class="ibm-plex-serif-regular">
        We have been friends as long as I can remember. Old enough to choose, I tucked your slender<br>
        Shape under my arm and kept it there Against the heart. Afterwards, everywhere I went, you went. Season throughout season,<br>
        I have continued in this with good reason. Caught in this kinship, I am not alone. Since the earliest letters charred on stone,<br>
        There have been, like me, many others; Reading, I am related to greater brothers. I think of an old man like Saint Jerome<br>
        Sitting in a sunlit wooden room Behind a table reading the books thereon And at his feet asleep his favorite lion —<br>
        And silence such, that Time's insistent knock Resembles merely the syllables of a clock.<br>
        I shall be faithful. You may count on this — Any kiss I give will be only a kiss.<br>
        You know the shape of the traitor's shoulder-blade. More than once, thin shadows they have made,<br>
        Sliding upwards, have passed across your pages.
